# Welcome to JodaPack
------------------

## Goals

The main goal of JodaPack is to create an original mod pack, with a fresh touch.

- "kitchen sink" mod pack
- lots of fun by exploring many different mod packs in more or less depth -> give options to the player
- fresh perspective for those who want it, by having lesser known/used mods, e.g. Deep Resonance, Psi, Refined Storage
- well known core mods, e.g. Botania, Ender IO, Blood Magic, etc.
- create many inter-dependencies between mods in order to allow player progression, with always at least two options
- achieveable by having core ingridients, like copper, enderium, mana steel/pearls, etc.
- have fun with mod pack development/configuration! :D

## Tasks / ToDo

- Finalize mods included to the pack
- Remove "overpowered" items and "too easy" resource/energy gathering via config
- Create inter-mod dependencies
- Tweak crafting recipes
- Test test test ...
