#Welcome to JodaPack
------------------

##Goals

The main goal of JodaPack is to recreate your classic "kitchen sink" mod pack, under a fresh perspective.

- classic "kitchen sink" mod pack
- fun by exploring lots of different mod packs in more or less depth -> give options to the player
- fresh perspective for those who want it, by having lesser known/used mods, e.g. Deep Resonance, Psi, Refined Storage
- well known core mods, e.g. Botania, Ender IO, Blood Magic, etc.
- create many inter-dependencies between mods in order to allow player progression, with always at least two options
- achieveable by having core ingridients, like copper, enderium, mana steel/pearls, etc.
- have fun with mod pack development / configuration! :D
